## Deploying Sample Application

To complete this lab, you will need an application/instance for Multicloud Defense to protect. If you don't have a readily avaliable application/instance, follow these steps to deploy a sampe application for this workshop. 

1. EC2 key pairs in **us-east-1** region

     * Navigate to **EC2 service** and under **Network & Security -> Key Pairs**, create a new key pair.
     * Provide a Name for the key pair. If you are using putty on Windows, select .ppk for the Private key file format. If using Mac/Linux, use .pem format.
     * You may need to change the permission of the downloaded private key. `chmod 400 <private key>.pem`
 
2. EC2 instances in the AWS account. These ec2 instances will be used to generate traffic and show the capabilities of Multicloud Defense. For this workshop, use the following [CloudFormation template](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fvaltix-public.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcloud-formation%2Faws-dev-day.yml&stackName=spoke1-vpc&param_AppAMI=valtix-default&param_BastionHost=no&param_InstanceType=t3a.small&param_KeyPairName=&param_Prefix=spoke1&param_SubnetBits=8&param_VPCCidr=10.0.0.0%2F16&param_ValtixResources=no&param_Zone1=us-east-1a&param_Zone2=us-east-1b) and deploy in AWS account.
    
     * This CloudFormation template will deploys two ec2 instances in two subnets inside one VPC. 
     * Below are the parameters needed for CloudFormation Template. Most parameters can be left as default. EC2 Key Pair is the option that the user needs to fill in. 

        Parameter | Description
        ----------|-------------
        Stack name| Name of the CloudFormation Stack.
        Prefix | A prefix that is used in the resource name
        VPC CIDR | The CIDR Block for VPC
        Subnet Bits | Number of bits for subnet.
        Availability Zone 1| Availability Zone to deploy the first EC2 instance
        Availability Zone 2| Availability Zone to deploy the second EC2 instance
        AMI for App Instance| AMI to use for the EC2 instance.
        Instance Type | Instance Type to use for EC2 instance
        EC2 Key Pair | The EC2 key pair to used for EC2 instance.
     
     * This would be referred to as spoke deployment or spoke1-vpc. If you want to use your own ec2 instances for this workshop, whenever there is reference to spoke, you can use your own ec2 instances.
